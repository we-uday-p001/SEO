## **Keyword Discovery Methodology**

(Ways by which we discovered the keywords)

### **1\. Google Trends:**

We utilized [**Google Trends**](https://trends.google.com/trends/ "trends") for our keyword research, focusing on the short-tail keyword "larval development" in the US region over the past 12 months. The data provided us with related queries/keywords that have been trending and consistently increasing for the past year. We filtered this data and retained the relevant information in our spreadsheet. By working on these keywords, we expect that we will be able to achieve higher rankings more easily.

### **2\. Google Search Console**

After reviewing the performance metrics in [**Google Search Console**](https://search.google.com/search-console/ "Search Console Dashboard"), we applied filters for location (USA), URL (specifically for the Laravel page), and date range (12 months). After selecting these metrics, we obtained related keywords and sorted them. We added these keywords to our spreadsheet because they were already ranking and had good impressions. Therefore, if we could rank for these keywords, we could give us quick results.

We took the main keywords we found for our above-mentioned techniques, such as "Laravel development" and "Laravel development company," and searched for them in the US region  of Google.
