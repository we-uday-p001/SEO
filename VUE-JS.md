To find pertinent keywords inside our domain, we examined industry trends, rival terms, and niche-specific subjects.

This involved analyzing their organic strategy to identify high-performing keywords and gaps we could exploit.

### **4\. Suggested Keywords/Auto Suggest**



We began by identifying a set of basic or "seed" keywords related to our industry, products, or services. These were broad terms that are relevant to our business. We entered each seed keyword into Googleâ€™s search bar and observed the autocomplete suggestions that appeared. These suggestions are based on popular searches related to the seed keyword, providing insights into common queries and long-tail keywords used by our target audience.

We compared multiple keywords simultaneously by entering them into Google Trends. This comparison helped identify which keywords were gaining or losing popularity, and which ones were trending upward
