As Google doesn't read images so if we describe them with image alt text it helps search engine bots like Google and Bing understand image content.

- **Some Important Points:**

  2. File Names: Use descriptive file names with keywords.
  3. Compression: Compress images to improve load times without sacrificing quality.

### 9\. Canonical Tags:

A canonical tag, also known as a canonical link or "rel canonical," is a tag in the source code of a page that indicates to search engines that a master copy of the page exists. Canonical tags are used in SEO to help search engines index the correct URL and avoid duplicate content.

Use canonical tags to prevent duplicate content issues.
